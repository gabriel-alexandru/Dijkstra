# Dijkstra Algorithm for the shortest path in a graph

### Interactive version made with GeoGebra applet

This is an interactive website that implements the famous Dijkstra Algorithm. This algorithm returns the shortest path in a graph from a starting node to an end node.

The website can be found [here](https://gabrielalexandru.altervista.org/projects/dijkstra)

I have preloaded a simple graph, but you can add new nodes and new edges using the point and segment function in the GeoGebra applet.

You can chenge the weight of every edge using the table.

This version is still a Work in Progress so there may by many bugs.
