# Dijkstra Algorithm for the shortest path in a graph

### Interactive version made with GeoGebra applet

This is an interactive website that implements the famous Dijkstra Algorithm. This algorithm returns the shortest path in a graph from a starting node to an end node.

I have preloaded a simple graph, but you can add new nodes and new edges using the point and segment function in the GeoGebra applet.

This version is still a Work in Progress so there may by many bugs.

### TO FIX

[ ] The shortest path graph needs to be cleared when inserting new nodes / edges or when checking the shortest path between two others nodes.

[ ] Simplify the process of retrieving the graph from GeoGebra and getting the shortest path, maybe using only a button instead of two.
